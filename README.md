  <h3>Stacklyzer - Website Technology Detector</h3>
</div>

## üåü Overview

Stacklyzer is an open-source website technology detection platform that helps developers, marketers, and researchers identify what technologies are being used on any website. The system analyzes websites and provides detailed insights about their tech stack, including frameworks, libraries, CMS platforms, analytics tools, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Detection**: Identifies a wide range of web technologies
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for analyzing websites
- **Detailed Results**: Provides in-depth information about each detected technology
- **Confidence Scoring**: Indicates reliability of each technology detection
- **Open Source**: Completely free and open for community contributions

## üß© Project Structure

The Stacklyzer project is structured as a monorepo containing:

- **[Backend](/backend)**: Node.js API for detecting website technologies
- **[Frontend](/frontend)**: Next.js web application interface
- **Upcoming Components**:
  - Chrome Extension: For instant technology detection while browsing
  - Android App: Mobile interface for on-the-go website analysis
  - NPM Package: For integrating technology detection in JavaScript projects

## üìä How It Works

1. Users enter a website URL through the Stacklyzer interface
2. The backend fetches and analyzes the website's HTML, JS, HTTP headers, and more
3. Advanced detection algorithms identify technologies using multiple signals
4. Results are categorized and presented with confidence ratings and additional details

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Heroku (backend), Vercel (frontend)
